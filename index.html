        <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
        <p>Which means that it was raining I guess.</p>
        <p>Better bring an umbrella.</p>
        <p>Or if you don't have an umbrella, a poncho. It should be brightly colored, because it's so dark out.</p>
        <p>I walked out in a lime green poncho I got at the ballpark last weekend.
            My cat meowed loudly as I set out into the wet night.
